#What is Authorization?
**Authorization** is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources related to information security and computer security in general and to access control in particular.    
_--Wikipedia [Authorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization)_ 

And usually the following terminologies also refer to similar function: access control, access management, entitlement management, etc.


#What is the difference between Authorization and Authentication?

for example, when you borrow a book from the library, you need to show library staff your id card. Then library staff will do   

1. Make sure you are the one your id card idenfies, i.e. who you are   
2. You have the privilege to borrow book, i.e. what you can do   

Step 1 is authentication, while step 2 is authorization in this case.
